# Python for Data Science Machine Learning
Python is an open-source community-supported, general-purpose programming language that, over the years, has also become one of the bastions of data science. Thanks to its flexibility and vast popularity that data analysis, visualization, and machine learning can be easily carried out with Python. This course will help you learn the tools necessary to perform data science.

In this course you will learn all the necessary libraries that make data analytics with Python a joy.You will get into hands-on data analysis and machine learning by coding in Python. You will also learn the Numpy library used for numerical and scientific computation. You will also employ useful libraries for visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn, to provide insights into data. Further you will learn various steps involved in building an end-to-end machine learning solution. The ease of use and efficiency of these tools will help you learn these topics very quickly. The video course is prepared with applications in mind. You will explore coding on real-life datasets, and implement your knowledge on projects.
